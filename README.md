# Classification-Systems
The project aims to delve into various classification systems using the MNIST dataset, which comprises 70,000 small images of digits handwritten by individuals from diverse backgrounds, including high school students and employees of the US Census Bureau. Through this project, we explore fundamental concepts and techniques in machine learning and data analysis while focusing on different aspects of classification tasks.

Topics Covered:

1. Training a Binary Classifier:
Introduction to binary classification
Implementing a binary classifier using MNIST dataset
Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score

2. Performance Measures:
Measuring accuracy using cross-validation
Understanding confusion matrices
Precision and recall metrics
The precision/recall trade-off
ROC curve analysis

3. Multiclass Classification:
Extending classification to multiple classes
Techniques for multiclass classification using MNIST dataset

4. Error Analysis:
Analyzing classification errors
Identifying patterns in misclassified instances
Strategies for improving model performance

5. Multilabel Classification:
Understanding multilabel classification tasks
Implementing multilabel classification using MNIST dataset

6. Multioutput Classification:
Introduction to multioutput classification
Building a basic structure of a face-recognition model using MNIST dataset
Understanding the concept of multioutput classification in the context of face recognition

Through hands-on implementation and analysis, participants will gain practical insights into the complexities and nuances of classification systems. By leveraging the MNIST dataset, known for its simplicity and relevance, this project offers a comprehensive understanding of classification techniques applicable in various real-world scenarios.
